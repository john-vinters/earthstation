Introduction
------------

EarthStation is a satellite tracking application written in Ada 2005 using
the GtkAda library for display.  The application uses the algorithms
described by James Miller G3RUH in the article "Plan-13 Satellite Position
Calculation Program" (read the article online at 
http://www.amsat.org/amsat/articles/g3ruh/111.html).

Requirements
------------

   * A reasonably recent GNAT Ada Compiler.  EarthStation was developed using
     GCC GNAT 4.4.2.  Versions of roughly this age or newer should work
     correctly.

   * GtkAda 2.14 or later.

   * FreeBSD or Linux.  (Other BSDs may work, but are currently untested).
